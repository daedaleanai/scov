# GCovHTML
> Process the intermediate text format generated by gcov to generate reports on line code coverage.

GCovHTML collects code coverage using `gcov`, and then generates nice HTML files to report on the data.

## Getting started

To generate a report on code coverage, you should already have an instrumented binary.  After running the binary, you will need to run `gcov` to convert the data to the intermediate text format.  Afterwards, you can run `gcovhtml` to create the HTML reports.

```shell
gcov -i [source files]
gcovhtml -title "My Report" -outdir ./html *.gcov
```

This will create a folder, and insert the HTML files into that folder.  Open `index.html` to get an overview of the code coverage, and follow the links for annotated source files.

### Options

**-external**   Set whether external files to be included

**-h**	Request help

**-htmldir [folder]**  	Path for the HTML output (default ".")

**-srcdir [folder]**  	Path for the source directory (default ".")

**-text [filename]**   	Filename for text report, use - for stdout

**-title string**    	Title for the HTML pages (default "LCovHTML")

## Installation

### From Source

To build a copy of `gcovhtml`, you will need a copy of [Go](https://golang.org/).  For instructions on how to install Go, please refer to the language's website.  No dependencies beyond the standard library are required, although `gcovhtml` does require version 1.10 or higher to run the  automated testing.

Once Go is installed, you can clone the repository and build the application.

```shell
go get gitlab.com/stone.code/gcovhtml
```

### Binaries

Current binaries are built with every commit, and can be downloaded from the [pipelines pages](https://gitlab.com/stone.code/gcovhtml/pipelines).
